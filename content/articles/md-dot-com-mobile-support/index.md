Well I did it - finally. I finally made this web page look somewhat normal for mobile devices. I only have my Nexus 5 to test with, but hopefully
things look decent on other devices as well. Oh, and I also took some of the code from [this experiment](/examples/d3-scramble/) to make the logo fancier.
