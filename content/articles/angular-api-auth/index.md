title: AngularJS: API Authentication
date: 2014-02-26 07:51

Last night I went to the [Orlando AngularJS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Orlando-AngularJS-Meetup/) and did a small presentation
on how to build a clean authentication mechanism for Angular apps communicating w/ a REST-style API.

The code I demonstrated during the presentation can be found [here](https://github.com/MandarinConLaBarba/angular-examples/tree/master/api-auth).
