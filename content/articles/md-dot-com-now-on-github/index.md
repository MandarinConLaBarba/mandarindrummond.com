So, the last few days I used a burned some inspiration to write my very own static site generator for
[MandarinDrummond.com](http://mandarindrummond.com). Not to take anything away from [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/),
but I was never completely satisfied with that setup. The new [MandarinDrummond.com](http://mandarindrummond.com)
site generator uses mustache templates, scss+foundation for styles, and a lot of other nifty tools. The
[site generator](https://github.com/MandarinConLaBarba/mandarindrummond.com/tree/master/lib/generator/flows) itself
relies heavily on my flow-control library, [Sebastian](http://mandarinconlabarba.github.io/sebastian/).
