Whether you love or hate Google, you can't deny they have some insanely smart developers working for them. One thing I've noticed over the past
year or so is how slick the Google+ UI is. I love how when you click to add a new post, all the other nearby boxes smartly move out
of the way and the form is brought front and center. If you haven't seen it, it's a thing of beauty and worth checking out.
In my never-ending battle against mediocrity, I thought I might try my hand at reproducing the affect.
