title: Sebastian - 0.2.1
date: 2013-07-29 7:31

As usual, been busy with life and all its complexities. But I've updated Sebastian some. The main thing is I fixed a major issue w/ context(). You can now
use the .create() method to create an execution and then call execute() on it. This allows for isolation of context() objects.

Oh an I made the Sebastian site a little better by adding runnable examples. Check it out [here](http://mandarinconlabarba.github.io/sebastian/).
